# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with layer.ai's API to generate 2D game assets and sprites. The server will enable seamless sprite generation within the development workflow, allowing developers to create game assets on-demand while respecting the free tier limitations of 600 assets per account.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to generate 2D sprites through an MCP server, so that I can quickly create game assets without leaving my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is configured THEN the system SHALL connect to layer.ai API using the provided personal access token
2. WHEN a sprite generation request is made THEN the system SHALL send the request to layer.ai API with appropriate parameters
3. WHEN the API responds successfully THEN the system SHALL return the generated sprite data to the requesting client
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message explaining the failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to specify sprite parameters and descriptions, so that I can generate assets that match my game's requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a sprite THEN the system SHALL accept a text description parameter for the desired asset
2. WHEN generating a sprite THEN the system SHALL accept optional style parameters (if supported by layer.ai)
3. WHEN generating a sprite THEN the system SHALL accept optional size/dimension parameters
4. WHEN parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL validate them before sending to the API
5. IF invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to track my API usage, so that I can stay within the free tier limit of 600 assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sprite is successfully generated THEN the system SHALL increment a usage counter
2. WHEN usage information is requested THEN the system SHALL return current usage count and remaining quota
3. WHEN approaching the usage limit THEN the system SHALL warn the user about remaining quota
4. IF the usage limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL prevent further API calls and return an appropriate error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to save generated sprites to my project, so that I can use them in my game development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sprite is generated THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save it to a specified file path
2. WHEN saving a sprite THEN the system SHALL support common image formats (PNG, JPG)
3. WHEN saving a sprite THEN the system SHALL create necessary directories if they don't exist
4. IF a file already exists at the target path THEN the system SHALL either overwrite or provide a unique filename based on user preference

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to be easily configurable, so that I can set it up quickly in my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the server THEN the system SHALL accept the personal access token through environment variables or configuration
2. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL validate the API token and connection
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN the server is running THEN the system SHALL expose standard MCP protocol endpoints

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and inform the user
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options
